# PhD
 
This repository contains research done as part of the work for a Ph.D. on Access Control for Solid, and the more theoretical work for the EU project [Solid Wallet](https://nlnet.nl/project/SolidWallet/index.html). 

The research is divided into two folders:

* [Logic](Logic/) - covers  various logics for access control
* [UseCases](UseCases/) - lists important access control use cases, extensions to [Web Access Control](https://solidproject.org/TR/wac) that can describe such access control scenarios, and the reasoning a client will need to follow to determine what type of proof to send the server Guard.
