This section collects research on Logics for access control.

* [Says.md](Says.md) - the basic modal logics of "Saying that" started in the early 1990s by Burrows, Abadi, Needham, Garg and others. 
* [ACL](ACL.md) - from Access Control Lists to Access Control Logics
* [ACLsDon't](ACLsDont.md) - an analysis of the argument against ACLs and in favor of capabilities. It turns out that AC logic with proofs is a form of capabilities.
* [RelBac](RelBac.md) - a description logic for access control based on simple relations
* [Verifiable Credentials](VerifiableCredentials.md) - a description of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model - and some problems discovered with the current mapping to N3
