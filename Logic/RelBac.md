RelBac is a description logic for Relation Based Access Control that was developed in the following  Papers: 

* 2008 - [RelBac: Relation Based Access Control](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8907609933770340304&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) by Fausto Giunchiglia; Rui Zhang; Bruno Crispo
* 2009 -  [Design and Run Time Reasoning with RelBAC](http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/1510/) by Zhang, Rui and Crispo, Bruno and Giunchiglia, Fausto 
* 2015 - [A Practical Framework for RelBAC Implementation](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1339/paper5.pdf) by Lei Liu, Quanzhu Tao, Fausto Giunchiglia and Rui Zhangâ‹†


I discussed it in Dec 2020 [authorization panel issue 150](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/150).

The main conclusion I came to was that it looked like WAC was a reified version of RelBac. 

RelBac is claimed to be an extension of RBac. (todo: more on what that means.)

Todo: how well does that map to WAC?
